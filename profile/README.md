# Rail Announcements

The goal of this GitHub organisation is to collate copies of UK railway announcements released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

Each organisation and type of announcement set (ideally) has its own repository. You can see a full list of these here: https://github.com/orgs/Rail-Announcements/repositories

Found announcements released under FOI that aren't here? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Rail-Announcements/.github/issues/new) and send us a link!
